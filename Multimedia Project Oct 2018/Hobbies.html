        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <h2>Video Gaming</h2> 
        <p>
            Personally, I am a member of VGS, the Video Gaming Society at Sussex.
            <br>
            I enjoy playing First Person Shooters, such as CounterStrike : Global Offensive, and Overwatch.
            <br>
            I like the tense action in-game, and the dedication and skill, in order to win the game.
            <br>
        </p>
        <h2>Violin</h2>
        <p>
            Personally, I have played violin since year 3, having reached grade 5.
            <br>
            I am a member of the Folk Society here at Sussex. Their style is improvising to various songs.
            <br>
            I enjoy playing the fast reels and jigs, they are catchy and fun!
            <br>
        </p>
        <h2>Tennis</h2>
        <p>
            Personally, I have played Tennis since year 8. I have entered competitions, but not succeeded yet. 
            <br>
            I am a member of the Sussex Tennis Club, where I join them for Social Tennis every sunday.
            <br>
            I find the sport intresting as you can have a real bond in doubles,
            <br>
            but still go on to beat that person in singles.
            <br>
